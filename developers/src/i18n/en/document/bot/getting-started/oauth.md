# OAuth Authorization

To access the personal information, assets, and other data of Mixin Messenger users, the developer needs to apply for authorization from the user.

### OAuth Scope

| Permission         |  Description                      |
|:------------------:|:----------------------------------|
| PROFILE:READ       | Get basic user information, such as user id, Mixin ID, name, and avatar.|
| ASSETS:READ        | Read user asset list and balance.            |
| PHONE:READ         | Read the user's mobile phone number.                   |
| CONTACTS:READ      | Read user contact list, block list.                 |
| MESSAGES:REPRESENT | Allow bots to send messages on behalf of users.                    |
| SNAPSHOTS:READ     | Access user's transfer records, including deposits and reminders.        |

The permissions requested should contain at least the PROFILE:READ permission. Users may uncheck certain permissions when authorizing. It is recommended that developers only apply for necessary permissions and make proper guidance GUIs in the absence of permissions.

### Requesting Authorization

When the bot detects that it is not authorized by a user, it should jump to `https://mixin-www.zeromesh.net/oauth/authorize?client_id=b7347ca4-186e-4e54-9db6-755a4ab0b5d4&scope=PROFILE:READ+ASSETS:READ&response_type=code&return_to=` to request authorization from the user. The parameters:

**Required Parameters**

- client_id - Bot ID.
- scope - requested permissions
- response_type - use "code" to return authorization code

**Optional Parameters**

- state - A random string generated by your application, which youâ€™ll verify later.
- code_challenge - The code challenge generated by your app, it's a SHA256 hash of your code verifier. For more information about it, please [visit here](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/authorization-request/)
- code_challenge_method - The code challenge method, please set it to `SHA256`

After successful authorization, the page will automatically jump to the bot's authentication URL, the callback URL will be accompanied by the authorization code and return_to parameters, and the developer will then request a token based on the authorization code:

```
POST https://api.mixin.one/oauth/token
{
    "client_id": "unique bot identifier",
    "code": "authorization code returned by the successful authorization callback",
    "client_secret": "bot key"
}

Returned data:
{
    "access_token": "user authorization token",
    "scope": "list of permissions that the user has given, e.g. 'PROFILE:READ ASSETS:READ'"
}
```

It is recommended that developers cache the access token and subsequently call the API to access the user data via the access token, to determine whether the user has authorized or not.

### Revoking Authorization

You can cancel the authorization of the bot in Mixin Messenger Settings - Privacy and Security - Authorization, and note that canceling the authorization will clear the client's current bot's cookies and other cache information.
